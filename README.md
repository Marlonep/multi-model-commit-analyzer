# Leviathan Multi-Model Commit Analyzer

> **The Leviathan Methodology: Where Code Speaks Louder Than Words**

An AI-powered platform that implements objective developer evaluation through Git commit analysis, enabling true meritocracy in decentralized teams. Built for organizations that believe in competition, transparency, and letting code quality determine value.

---

## ü¶Ö The Leviathan Methodology

### Core Principle
**1 day = 1 commit (minimum)**

Why? Because we need to measure your real impact. No fluff.

### Why This Exists

Teams don't need to be in the same office‚Äîor even the same time zone‚Äîto deliver value. The Leviathan Methodology is a foundation for **objective meritocracy** in the era of AI, designed to accelerate decentralized teams by making **Git the single source of truth**.

Every commit is tracked, scored, and evaluated objectively by our Leviathan platform, so contributions don't get buried in Slack threads or Zoom calls. This is for people who welcome competition and free expression, who thrive in a system that rewards impact over politics.

> **Important**: Humans must stay in the loop‚Äîsoft skills, long-term vision, and organizational value can't be fully captured by metrics alone. This methodology is far from perfect and isn't for everyone. It's a starting point, not the whole picture.

### Philosophy

The name "Leviathan" comes from Thomas Hobbes' idea of a social contract, where individuals unite for the common good under a shared system. Our methodology reflects this: every commit you make contributes to the collective value of the team.

We believe in:
- **Objective Meritocracy**: Let code quality and impact speak for itself
- **Radical Transparency**: All metrics are visible and auditable
- **Decentralized Excellence**: Great work happens everywhere, anytime
- **Continuous Competition**: Healthy rivalry drives innovation
- **Self-Management**: Autonomous teams with clear accountability

*Inspired by George Hotz's philosophy of hacker culture and technical excellence.*

## üìä What Actually Counts (The Metrics)

Every commit you push to Git gets scored by multiple AI models. No human bias, no personal agendas‚Äîjust a baseline to measure your value to the organization.

### Scoring Criteria

#### üéØ Code Quality (30% weight) - Scale: 1.0-5.0
**Based on**: Readability, structure, error handling, adherence to best practices, absence of defects

- **1.0-2.0**: Significant issues (multiple errors, poor structure)
- **2.1-3.0**: Some issues (inconsistent style, minor errors)  
- **3.1-4.0**: Minor issues (mostly clean, small improvements needed)
- **4.1-5.0**: Exemplary (clean, well-structured, robust)

#### ‚ö° Code Impact (25% weight) - Scale: 1.0-5.0
**Based on**: Architectural contributions, problem-solving sophistication, scalability, alignment with goals

- **1.0-1.5**: Minimal impact (basic fixes, no architectural contribution)
- **1.6-2.5**: Moderate impact (solves problems, some design consideration)
- **2.6-3.5**: Strong impact (good architecture, scalable solutions)
- **3.6-4.5**: High impact (significant advancement, robust design)
- **4.6-5.0**: Exceptional impact (game-changing solutions, innovative)

#### üß© Code Complexity (20% weight) - Scale: 1.0-5.0
**Based on**: Files changed, logical intricacy, integration points, problem difficulty

- **1.0-2.0**: Simple changes (single-file edits, basic logic)
- **2.1-3.0**: Moderate (multiple files, some integration)
- **3.1-4.0**: Complex (intricate logic, cross-module integration)
- **4.1-5.0**: Very complex (system-wide changes, high difficulty)

#### ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Development Time (20% weight)
**Based on**: Realistic time for this exact change, inferred from commit metadata

#### üë®‚Äçüíª Developer Level (20% weight) - Scale: 1.0-5.0
**Based on**: Code patterns, architecture decisions, error handling sophistication

- **1.0-1.5**: Beginner (minimal changes, rudimentary patterns)
- **1.6-2.5**: Junior (basic changes, simple patterns)
- **2.6-3.5**: Mid-level (good practices, some architecture)
- **3.6-4.5**: Senior (advanced patterns, excellent design)
- **4.6-5.0**: Expert (cutting-edge patterns, innovative architecture)

### Additional Metrics
- **AI Code Percentage**: How much AI assistance was used
- **Time Savings**: Efficiency gained through AI tools
- **Lines Added/Deleted**: Volume and refactoring impact

## üéÆ Rules of the Game

### Basics
- ‚úÖ **Drafts count** - Work in progress is still progress
- ‚úÖ **No commit = day didn't happen** - That simple
- ‚úÖ **Your code speaks for you** - Quality over quantity
- ‚úÖ **Git is the single source of truth** - Everything lives there

### Platform Integration
- **FlutterFlow** ‚Üí commit with your Git user
- **V0** ‚Üí include the link in the commit message  
- **Everything must be trackable in Git**

### Collaboration Rules
- If you researched or had meetings, note it objectively in the commit
- If someone helped you code or fix a bug, add them as a co-author
- If the project's in the client's repo, use mirror or push summary to your org's repo

### Document What Matters
- **Share what you learned** - Knowledge compounds
- **If ChatGPT helped, drop the link** - It might help someone else
- **Links to useful resources** = time saved for the team

### Invisible Work Counts Too
- **Pair programming** ‚Üí log the insights
- **Code reviews** ‚Üí share the knowledge  
- **Configs** ‚Üí document the tricks and research
- **Testing** ‚Üí record the edge cases

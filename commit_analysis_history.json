However, it might benefit from additional input validation to handle edge cases more gracefully (this is a minor point). The `dev_level` score reflects the solid understanding of git and JavaScript demonstrated but also some areas where a more senior developer might have implemented more refined error handling or made more optimal choices for some string manipulation. The `complexity` score reflects the moderate complexity of the added logic; it's not overly intricate, but it's more than a simple change. The AI percentage is relatively low because the core logic—parsing git config and remote URLs—requires a good understanding of git and shell commands, which is less suited for AI generation at this time.  AI could've assisted in generating parts of the error handling and string manipulation, which is why there's some AI contribution.

The developer level is mid-range due to the structured approach to documentation. Complexity is moderate to high given the integration of multiple AI models and token estimation logic. Estimated hours reflect the effort to write detailed comments across 7 files. AI percentage is moderate as the structure suggests some templated or generated comments. With AI assistance, time is reduced due to potential automation of comment generation.",

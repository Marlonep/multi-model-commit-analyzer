        "reasoning": "The commit focuses on a UI transformation, suggesting a well-defined scope.  A code quality of 4.0 reflects a likely well-structured and functional implementation of a dark theme. The developer level is rated 2.2 because while the task is not overly complex, it requires understanding of UI frameworks and theming concepts. The complexity is rated 2.8 due to the number of files changed (6) and lines added (364), suggesting that although the task is not exceptionally complex, it involves a reasonable amount of work.  The estimated development time of 4 hours accounts for the number of lines changed and the need for thorough testing. The AI percentage is set at 30%, assuming some parts (like color palette generation or basic styling) may have been aided by AI but most of the structural changes and implementation required manual effort. With AI assistance, time is reduced by about 1.2 hours, to 2.8 hours, reflecting the time saved on repetitive or less critical aspects of the theme implementation.",

The number of files changed (6) and the lines added (364) and deleted (100) indicate a moderate-sized change. The developer appears to be an experienced mid-level engineer capable of handling this level of complexity. The code complexity is high due to the extensive UI changes and the need to ensure a consistent and visually appealing theme across multiple components. The estimated development time is relatively high, but the AI percentage is lower, as the UI transformation likely requires more manual work and design decisions.

While a significant number of lines were added (364), this is likely due to the nature of UI changes which often involve many small modifications.  The deletion of 100 lines suggests refactoring rather than simple addition.  A code quality of 4.0 reflects a well-executed theme change, assuming it's functional and well-structured. The developer level is rated 2.2 as it demonstrates competence in UI development but doesn't necessarily show advanced skills.  The complexity is rated 2.8 because a theme change is usually not highly complex, although managing the interactions between numerous elements could present some moderate challenges.  The estimated time of 3 hours accounts for potential UI debugging and integration testing.  A 25% AI contribution is estimated because AI might have assisted with some repetitive CSS changes or even layout generation, but the creative and design aspects likely demanded manual effort.",

        "reasoning": "The code changes show a good understanding of user authentication, with the addition of password hashing using a more secure algorithm (SHA256) and the implementation of token-based authentication. The overall structure and implementation are well-designed, indicating a good level of coding expertise. The complexity is moderate, as the code handles user management, password hashing, and token generation, which are common features in web applications. The estimated development time is on the higher side, as the implementation of a full-fledged authentication system, including error handling and edge cases, can take a significant amount of time to complete.",

        "reasoning": "The code quality is decent (3.7).  The switch from MD5 to SHA256 is a positive, and adding user creation and JWT token generation demonstrates understanding of basic authentication. However, the hardcoded secret key is a significant flaw, reducing the score.  The developer level is rated as mid-level (2.3) given the understanding of hashing and JWT, but also due to the security vulnerability of the hardcoded key. The complexity is moderate (2.8) due to the relatively straightforward implementation of core features. However, there's room for improvement in terms of error handling and security. The estimated time of 4.5 hours accounts for implementation, testing, and considering the need to address the security issue of the hardcoded secret key.",

Developer level seems mid-level, as the implementation shows basic understanding of authentication but lacks advanced security practices. Complexity is moderate with the addition of JWT token generation and user management. Estimated hours reflect a reasonable time for implementing basic authentication with minor revisions.",

However, it might benefit from additional input validation to handle edge cases more gracefully (this is a minor point). The `dev_level` score reflects the solid understanding of git and JavaScript demonstrated but also some areas where a more senior developer might have implemented more refined error handling or made more optimal choices for some string manipulation. The `complexity` score reflects the moderate complexity of the added logic; it's not overly intricate, but it's more than a simple change. The AI percentage is relatively low because the core logic—parsing git config and remote URLs—requires a good understanding of git and shell commands, which is less suited for AI generation at this time.  AI could've assisted in generating parts of the error handling and string manipulation, which is why there's some AI contribution.
